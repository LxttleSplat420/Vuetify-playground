3) Each component can be edited/ experimented with using the panel on the right hand side of the respective component by clicking on the respective property/ properties you would like to edit on the panel and changing it. 
4) Components can now be searched using the magnifying icon at the top.
5) Components search filter can also now be changed by using the filter Icon at the top.
6) Components can now have their states exported to a file, which can be shared as well as imported to reload the component values.
7) URL links can be copy and pasted to quickly navigate to the desired webpage with the Search and Filter autofilled.
